# Heart-Disease-Classification
The project Heart Disease Classification is a comprehensive machine learning endeavor aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on their medical attributes. Utilizing Python alongside various machine learning and data science libraries, the notebook outlines a structured approach to tackle this problem, encompassing problem definition, data acquisition, evaluation metrics, feature selection, modeling, and experimentation.

The primary goal is defined as determining whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical parameters, with the ambition of achieving at least 95% accuracy during the proof of concept phase before moving forward with the project. The data utilized originates from the Cleveland dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, with an alternative version available on Kaggle.

The project breaks down into several key sections:

Problem Definition: Establishing the objective to predict heart disease presence based on clinical parameters.
Data: Using the Cleveland dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, supplemented by Kaggle.
Evaluation: Setting a target of 95% prediction accuracy as the threshold for project continuation.
Features: Detailed data dictionary creation, including patient ID, age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more.
Following these foundational sections, the notebook delves into tool preparation, data exploration (EDA), including analyzing heart disease frequency according to sex and chest pain type, among other analyses. This structured approach underscores a thorough and methodical exploration of the data, feature engineering, and model building to accurately predict heart disease.
